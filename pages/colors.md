# Colors
The intranet has a clear and distinct color scheme mostly in gray scale that gives focus to the content and the applications and makes it easy for the user to perform her work. Colors used in the major applications are defined in the [variables Sass file](https://github.com/malmostad/intranet-assets/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/variables.css.scss). Fork it and use it in the application.

Other colors are available in the [branding guidelines](https://malmo.se/Kommun--politik/Sa-arbetar-vi-med.../Kommunikationsfragor/Grafisk-manual.html).
